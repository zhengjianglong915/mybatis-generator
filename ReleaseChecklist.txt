   GitHub milestone for this release.

Releasing Core:

1. Clone the main repo (with ssh), checkout the master branch
2. cd core
3. mvn release:prepare
4. mvn release:perform (this also updates the site)
5. Logon to https://oss.sonatype.org/
6. Find the mybatis staging repo
7. Verify everything looks OK (I usually delete the bundle files as they're not
   really maven artifacts)
8. Close the repo
9. Release the repo

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Releasing the Eclipse Feature:

1. Clone the main repo and checkout the release tag.  e.g.:
   
   git clone https://github.com/mybatis/generator.git
   cd generator
   git checkout mybatis-generator-1.4.1
   
2. cd eclipse/
3. mvn -Prelease-composite clean integration-test
4. cd ../org.mybatis.generator.eclipse.site/target/p2-composite-repo
5. Edit jfrogUpload.sh and add your jFrog credentials

Final Details:

1. If the DTD has changed, then update it at https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis.github.io
2. Make a Github Release that contains the Bundle and the Zipped Eclipse Site
3. Send announcement to mailing list
4. Write a blog post
5. Update the version numbers in all the Eclipse projects with the tycho-versions plugin.  For example:

   git checkout master
   cd eclipse/
   mvn tycho-versions:set-version -DnewVersion=1.4.1-SNAPSHOT
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update Eclipse versions for new release"
   git push
